            <p class="bodyText">
              I am a technically oriented young professional with a Diploma of Higher Education in computer science from
              Swansea University. I enjoy playing sports, mountaineering and helping others (especially in matters regarding
              technology). I relish the challenge of finding optimal solutions to technical problems. I am particularly
              interested in topics regarding web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript with my favourite modules
              at university being web and android development as well as graphics programming.

              Interests
            </h2>
            <p class="bodyText">
              As a student, I was introduced to the sport of korfball. I went on to spend three years on the committee of
              Swansea University Korfball Club, as treasurer as well as a year as first-team captain. I have run training
              sessions, refereed matches in the Welsh league and shot clocked at national BUCS tournaments. This has
              helped me to develop skills such as organisation, communication and motivating others.
              I enjoy running and hiking in my spare time and have participated in several hiking events including the Ten
              Tors Challenge 3 times as well as the junior trophy for the 30-mile gold Cotswold Marathon night hike in 2018.
              I have also completed several mountaineering trips including trips to the Pyrenees, Alps, Dolomites and the
              Atlas Mountains in Morocco. These trips have allowed me to develop skills such as perseverance, adaptability
              and organisation.

              Work Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="bodyText">
              In 2017 whilst I was in Sixth Form I was employed by a local preschool to redesign their website with a focus
              on improving responsive design and readability. I continued to maintain the site voluntarily until 2022, adding
              both an admin portal and a dynamic list of recently published newsletters. The following link will take you to
              this site 
              In 2018 I completed work experience with a local civil engineering and scientific consultancy firm Edenvale
              Young. This gave me experience working in an office environment and insights into computational modelling
              and the use of GIS software to model flood risks.

              Programming skills
            </h2>
            <p class="bodyText">
              I have knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as experience using several
              javascript 3D graphics libraries such as babylon.js and three.js. I am also able to program in Python and Java
              and have some experience scripting in PHP.
