            <p class="mb-4 text-lg" style="color:#212121; ">
              I am a young professional, currently based in Bristol, looking to start a career in Web Design and I
              would like to apply for the position of Junior Web Designer with your company. I am a quick learner
              and enjoy working with others to find optimal solutions to technical problems. I have completed a
              number of web design projects both as part of my university course and independently. I have
              proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as scripting languages such as Python and PHP.

            Personal statement
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-3 text-lg" style="color:#212121; ">
            I am a technically oriented young professional with a Diploma of Higher Education in computer science from
            Swansea University. I enjoy playing sports, mountaineering and helping others (especially in matters regarding
            technology). I relish the challenge of finding optimal solutions to technical problems. I am particularly
            interested in topics regarding web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript with my favourite modules
            at university being web and android development as well as graphics programming.

            Interests
          </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg" style="color:#212121;">
            As a student, I was introduced to the sport of korfball. I went on to spend three years on the committee of
            Swansea University Korfball Club, as treasurer as well as a year as first-team captain. I have run training
            sessions, refereed matches in the Welsh league and shot clocked at national BUCS tournaments. This has
            helped me to develop skills such as organisation, communication and motivating others.
            I enjoy running and hiking in my spare time and have participated in several hiking events including the Ten
            Tors Challenge 3 times as well as the junior trophy for the 30-mile gold Cotswold Marathon night hike in 2018.
            I have also completed several mountaineering trips including trips to the Pyrenees, Alps, Dolomites and the
            Atlas Mountains in Morocco. These trips have allowed me to develop skills such as perseverance, adaptability
            and organisation.

            Work Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg" style="color:#212121;">
            In 2017 whilst I was in Sixth Form I was employed by a local preschool to redesign their website with a focus
            on improving responsive design and readability. I continued to maintain the site voluntarily until 2022, adding
            both an admin portal and a dynamic list of recently published newsletters. The following link will take you to
            this site https://www.noahsarkps.org.uk.
            In 2018 I completed work experience with a local civil engineering and scientific consultancy firm Edenvale
            Young. This gave me experience working in an office environment and insights into computational modelling
            and the use of GIS software to model flood risks.

            Programming skills
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg" style="color:#212121;">
            I have knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as experience using several
            javascript 3D graphics libraries such as babylon.js and three.js. I am also able to program in Python and Java
            and have some experience scripting in PHP.
