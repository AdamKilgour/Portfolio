            Personal statement
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-bodyText" >
          I am a technically oriented young professional with a Diploma of Higher Education in computer science from
          Swansea University. I enjoy playing sports, mountaineering and helping others (especially in matters regarding
          technology). I relish the challenge of finding optimal solutions to technical problems. I am particularly
          interested in topics regarding web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript with my favourite modules
          at university being web and android development as well as graphics programming.
        </p>

          Interests
        </h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-bodyText">
          As a student, I was introduced to the sport of korfball. I went on to spend three years on the committee of
          Swansea University Korfball Club, as treasurer as well as a year as first-team captain. I have run training
          sessions, refereed matches in the Welsh league and shot clocked at national BUCS tournaments. This has
          helped me to develop skills such as organisation, communication and motivating others.
          I enjoy running and hiking in my spare time and have participated in several hiking events including the Ten
          Tors Challenge 3 times as well as the junior trophy for the 30-mile gold Cotswold Marathon night hike in 2018.
          I have also completed several mountaineering trips including trips to the Pyrenees, Alps, Dolomites and the
          Atlas Mountains in Morocco. These trips have allowed me to develop skills such as perseverance, adaptability
          and organisation.
        </p>

          Work Experience
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-bodyText">
          In 2017 whilst I was in Sixth Form I was employed by a local preschool to redesign their website with a focus
          on improving responsive design and readability. I continued to maintain the site voluntarily until 2022, adding
          both an admin portal and a dynamic list of recently published newsletters. The following link will take you to
          this site 
          In 2018 I completed work experience with a local civil engineering and scientific consultancy firm Edenvale
          Young. This gave me experience working in an office environment and insights into computational modelling
          and the use of GIS software to model flood risks.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">
          Programming skills
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          I have knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as experience using several
          javascript 3D graphics libraries such as babylon.js and three.js. I am also able to program in Python and Java
          and have some experience scripting in PHP.
